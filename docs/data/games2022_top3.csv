Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&#10;&#10;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZYp_3BTDGjh2unaZfZmuA__original/img/7d-lj5Gd1e8PFnD97LYFah2c45M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2437871.jpg

At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series&#10;&#10;",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Qer2BBPG7qGGDu6KcVDIw__original/img/PlzAH7swN1nsFxOXbfUvE3TkE5w=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2452831.png
224517,Brass: Birmingham,2018,3,8.41823,25515,3824,38126,11846,128,3.8988,2,4,60,120,14,"['Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Transportation']",[],"Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&#10;&#10;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&#10;&#10;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&#10;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&#10;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&#10;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&#10;5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&#10;&#10;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&#10;&#10;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&#10;&#10;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&#10;&#10;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&#10;&#10;New &quot;Sell&quot; system&#10;&#10;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&#10;&#10;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&#10;&#10;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&#10;&#10;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&#10;&#10;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&#10;&#10;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&#10;&#10;",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg
