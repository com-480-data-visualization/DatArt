                <p>From Tokyo to São Paulo, board games bring people together. But they're not just about fun — they're cultural artifacts. They show how we socialize, strategize, and connect. From strategy-heavy to fast-paced party games, the board game industry has grown explosively in recent years. But how has it evolved? What do our favorite games say about us? And how did global events like the pandemic shape the way we play?</p>
                <p>In this project, we explore the evolution of board games in 2019, 2022, and 2025 across genres, countries, and player behaviors through interactive data visualizations powered by BoardGameGeek data.</p>

                <p>We begin our journey with the games that left their mark around the world. In 2019, 2022, and 2025, different titles rose to the top, each reflecting how and what people played during that time.</p>
                <p>Select a year and flip the cards to see which games stood out, and why they became favorites. You can see the title, rating (out of 10), complexity (on a scale of 5, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty), recommended number of players, and year of publication.</p>

                <p>Now that we have seen which games stood out, let's explore how different board game categories rose and fell between 2019 and 2025. The data reveals some subtle (and surprising) shifts in player preferences. Hover over each point to see the exact proportion value.</p>

                <p>Not only did category preferences change, but board games also evolved in other ways. Games, on average, became less complex. The recommended number of players dropped. Solo play options grew — likely a response to pandemic-era isolation — while age suitability remained almost unchanged.</p>
                <p>These trends hint at a shift toward flexibility and accessibility. Use the selector below to explore these changes year by year and see how player preferences have shaped game design over time.</p>
